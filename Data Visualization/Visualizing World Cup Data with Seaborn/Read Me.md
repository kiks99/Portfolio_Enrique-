# Visualizing World Cup data With Seaborn

For this project, we will be exploring data from the [Fifa World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup)from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about the world's game, fútbol!

This Fifa World Cup data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup) . Using Seaborn we will create a series of plots that explore aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games. 

## A little primer on the Fifa World Cup:

The FIFA World Cup, or simply the World Cup, is an international fútbol competition where 32 countries qualify to send teams made up of the best players from that nation to compete against each other for the World Cup championship.

The World Cup championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.

The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of one month.

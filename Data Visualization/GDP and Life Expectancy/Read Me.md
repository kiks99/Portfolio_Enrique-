# GDP and Life Expectancy 

## Introduction

For this project, we will act as a data researcher for the **I**nternational **H**eadquarter of **E**mpathy **A**nd **L**ogic (**IHEAL**). We will be helping them analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to support their case that there is a correlation or pattern between the GDP and life expectancy of a country.

During this project, we will analyze, prepare, and plot data, and seek to answer questions in a meaningful way.

**Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?**

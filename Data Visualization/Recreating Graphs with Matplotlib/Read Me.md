# Recreating Graphs using Matplotlib!

We are going to imagine that we are working as a high school math teacher. We want to display important metrics about our current class and other classes from previous years, in order to understand patterns and trends that may not be visible from just seeing the numbers in a spreadsheet. 

In this project we are going to re-create some graphs in Matplotlib. Let's go!

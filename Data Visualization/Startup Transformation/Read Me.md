# Startup Transformation
In this project, we’ll work as a data analyst for a tech startup that is looking to improve its operations after a global pandemic has taken the world by storm.

We will apply data transformation techniques to make better sense of the company’s data and help answer important questions such as:

- Is the company in good financial health?
- Does the company need to let go of any employees?
- Should the company allow employees to work from home permanently?

### Summary Statistics 
* [Census Variables](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Summary%20Statistics/Census%20Variables/Census%20Variables%20.ipynb): Using variable handling tools in panda we made some analysis of a small census dataset. Includes use of categorical data , cat.codes and median

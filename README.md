### Summary Statistics 
* [Census Variables](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Summary%20Statistics/Census%20Variables/Census%20Variables%20.ipynb): Using variable handling tools in panda we made some analysis of a small census dataset. Includes use of categorical data , cat.codes and median 
* [Life Expectancy by Country](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Summary%20Statistics/Life%20Expectancy%20by%20Country/Life%20Expectancy%20by%20Country%20.ipynb): Using quartiles and histograms to check the differences in life expectancy between countries with different GDP's 
* [Summarizing Evaluation Data](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Summary%20Statistics/Summarizing%20%20Automobile%20Evaluation%20Data/Summarizing%20Automobile%20Evaluation%20Data.ipynb): Using panda tools to summarize different information about an automobile dataset. 
* [Healthcare in Different States](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Summary%20Statistics/Health%20Care%20in%20Different%20States/Healthcare%20in%20Different%20States.ipynb): Using boxplots we can see the difference between states from a different array of procedures and diseases, we included chest pain and alcohol and drug abuse in this project. 

### Hypothesis Testing
* [Heart Disease Research pt. 1](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Hypothesis%20Testing/Heart%20Disease%20Research%20pt.%201/Heart%20Disease%20Research%20Part%201.ipynb): Realizing hypothesis testing using statistic tools to investigate more about heart diseases. 
* [Heart Disease Research pt. 2](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Hypothesis%20Testing/Heart%20Disease%20Research%20pt.%202/Heart%20Disease%20Research%20pt.%202.ipynb): Using different hypothesis methods and tools we realized tests to investigate further on the significance of health variables in the prediction of hert disease in patients.  
* [Familiar: A Study in Data Analysis](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Hypothesis%20Testing/Familiar%20A%20study%20in%20Data%20Analysis/Familiar%20A%20Study%20in%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Using different hypothesis testing tools we'll find ouut the difference between blood transfusion subjects. 
* [Analyzing Farmburg's A/B Test ](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Hypothesis%20Testing/Analyzing%20Farmburgs%20AB%20Test/Analyzing%20Farmburg's%20A_B%20Test%20.ipynb): Using binomial test we take decisons around the price of a start-up game upgrade. 
### Data Visualization
* [Exploring Mushrooms](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Exploring%20Mushrooms/Exploring%20Mushrooms%20.ipynb): Using seaborn couuntplot we'll be discovering the characteristics of the fungus world !
* [Startup Transformation](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Startup%20Transformation/Startup%20Transformation.ipynb): Using visualization and data transformations we take actions about revenue vs. expense , employee productivity and commute times inside a startup company.  
* [Recreating Graphs with Matplotlib](https://github.com/kiks99/Portfolio_Enrique-/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Recreating%20Graphs%20with%20Matplotlib/Recreating%20Graphs%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb): Using different types of graphs we make visualizations for a high school class. We use side by side graphs, stacked graphs and plot lines with error shading

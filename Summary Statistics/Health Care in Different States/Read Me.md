# Healthcare in Different States
In this project, we will use boxplots to investigate the way hospitals in different states across the United States charge their patients for medical procedures. The data originally came from the United State Health and Human Services Department. Due to veing a large size file, the CSV with the data was'nt able to upload to this git.

# Us Census Data 
We just got hired as a Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, which collects census data and creates interesting visualizations and insights from it.

The person who had our job before us left us all the data they had for the most recent census. It is in multiple csv files. They didnâ€™t use pandas, they would just look through these csv files manually whenever they wanted to find something. Sometimes they would copy and paste certain numbers into Excel to make charts.

The thought of it makes us shiver. This is not scalable or repeatable.

Our boss wants us to make some scatterplots and histograms by the end of the day. Can we get this data into pandas and into reasonable shape so that we can make these histograms?

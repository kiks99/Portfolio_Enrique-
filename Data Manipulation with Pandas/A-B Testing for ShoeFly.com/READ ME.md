# A/B Testing for Shoefly.com

Our favorite online shoe store, ShoeFly.com is performing an A/B Test. We have two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. We want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week. We are going to analyze the data using aggregate measures.
